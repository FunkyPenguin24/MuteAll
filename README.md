# MuteAll-DiscordBot-AmongUs

In among us, there's always this one dude who don't mute their mic and keeps talking during the game (outside of meeting times) and ruins the experience for everyone. It is frustrating and time-consuming to mute everyone one by one, so I made this bot that will server-mute everyone in a voice chat with one simple command.
  
  - Type ```.m``` to mute and ```.u``` to unmute everyone in your current voice channel.
  
  - Type ```.help``` to view all the commands with detailed info.
